# 👋 Hey, I'm Erik Schwerdt

Backend-focused developer with a strong interest in **scalable architectures, performance, and cloud infrastructure**.  
I enjoy building robust APIs, designing clean backend systems, and digging into how things work under the hood.

Currently working mostly with **Node.js & TypeScript**, but always learning and expanding into areas like **cloud-native systems, distributed services, and Go**.

I care about:
- Clean architecture & maintainability  
- Performance and scalability  
- Infrastructure as code & automation  
- Building things that actually survive production 🚀
